# OcamlHexWithMCTS

### Overview
This is an agent that plays the game `Hex` against an opponent. It makes moves using `MCTS` (Monte Carlo Tree Search) with pruning methods implemented as well as using **RAVE** for determining the childs to explore rather than **UCT/UCB**. This has been written completely in Ocaml and a compiled executable is also in this repository hence can be run on a Unix system without any dependencies.
